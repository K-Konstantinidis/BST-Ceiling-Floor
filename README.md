# BST-Ceiling-Floor
This is a c project in which the user enters an amount of numbers (>2) and then these numbers get inserted 
in a Binary Search Tree (BST). 
After all the insertions, the user enters a number and the program displays in the console 
the ceiling and the floor of the number.

The ceiling will be the the next largest number in the BST, in comparison to the one the user asked to search for.

The floor will be the the next smallest number in the BST, in comparison to the one the user asked to search for.

If the user tries to insert the same number twice, then a message will be displayed saying 
"the number is already in the BST".

If the user wants to stop searching for a ceiling and a floor, then they just have to insert a negative number 
as the search number, and the program will terminate.
